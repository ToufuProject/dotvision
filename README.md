# DotVision

> **Experience the thrill of low-res life.**

In a world obsessed with high resolution,
**DotVision** invites you to embrace simplicity —
where even the most handsome face is reduced to a charming grid of squares.

This Python + OpenCV project converts your live webcam feed
into a pixelated, retro-style animation.
Like a Game Boy, but it's your face. In real time.
